## Holder

This guide covers how to get started from the lenses of a holder app. i.e, the responsibilities include provisioning & storage of digital identities.

Initially we'll cover the steps required to create an mDoc & store it in a secure area.

The Holder implementation consists of several key components:

- **[Storage](/docs/getting-started/holder/storage)** - Initialize secure storage and cryptographic infrastructure
- **[DocumentStore](/docs/getting-started/holder/documentstore)** - Set up repositories and storage for document types
- **[Creation of an mDoc](/docs/getting-started/holder/creation)** - Create and provision mDoc credentials
- **[Lookup and Manage Documents](/docs/getting-started/holder/lookup)** - Fetch, list, and manage documents
- **[Presentation](/docs/getting-started/holder/presentation)** - Present credentials to verifiers
- **[Reader Trust](/docs/getting-started/holder/reader-trust)** - Manage trust relationships with verifier apps

Additional sections will be added as we continue building out the documentation.
